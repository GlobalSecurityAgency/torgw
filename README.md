Multiple rotating Tor proxy ( forked from https://github.com/HarryR/torgw.git )
===========================


__Goal__ : Use lots of different Tor proxies for multi-threaded requests and concurrency...

__How it works__ : runit manages many instances of Tor. HAproxy is used to distribute requests in a round-robin fashion.


```
                        <-> Tor proxy 1
Client <---->  HAproxy  <-> Tor proxy 2
                        <-> Tor proxy n
```

__Why is this one different?__ : Lightweight (16mb) Alpine docker image, doesn't use Ruby, low memory requirements, uses `runit` for process management. Doesn't provide a HTTP proxy.

Usage : 
-------

A `Makefile` is provided to manage the Docker container's lifecycle. Be wary, `make clean` will not be friendly to other Docker containers running on the same machine, it will aggressively purges unused containers and images.

    make
    make run
    make stop
